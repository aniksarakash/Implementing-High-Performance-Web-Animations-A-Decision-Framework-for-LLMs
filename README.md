  duration: 1,
  ease: "power2.inOut"
});
```

### 🌌 Three.js: WebGL-Powered 3D Graphics

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Production%20Ready-success)

Three.js is the go-to JavaScript library for incorporating 3D graphics and animations into web projects, providing a high-level abstraction over WebGL.

#### Key Features
- 🌟 Enables rich 3D content on the web
- 🚀 GPU-accelerated rendering
- 🧊 3D models, lighting, materials, and camera controls
- 📱 Cross-platform and responsive
- 🧰 Large ecosystem of plugins and extensions

#### Use Cases

#### Limitations
- Steep learning curve (3D concepts)
- Heavy resource usage
- Large file size (~150KB+)
- Requires additional tools for timeline animations

```javascript
// Basic Three.js scene setup
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Create cube
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);
camera.position.z = 5;

// Animation loop
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
  cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

### 🔄 Framer Motion (React Motion Library)

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Production%20Ready-success)

Framer Motion is a popular animation library specifically for React, offering a declarative, component-based approach to animations with physics-powered motion.

#### Key Features
- ⚛️ Seamless React integration
- 🔄 Animates outside React's render cycle for performance
- 🎮 Built-in gesture support (hover, tap, drag)
- 📦 Component-based animations with variants
- 🎭 AnimatePresence for mount/unmount transitions

#### Use Cases
- React UI transitions
- Gesture-based interactions
- Component mount/unmount animations
- Shared element transitions
- Layout animations

#### Limitations
- React-only (not for vanilla JS or other frameworks)
- Requires React to be loaded
- Less low-level control than GSAP
- Learning curve for variants system

```jsx
// Basic Framer Motion example
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

function Component() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
    >
      Animated content
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

### 🎨 Lottie: High-Quality Animations from Design Tools

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Production%20Ready-success)

Lottie is a library for rendering Adobe After Effects animations on the web and mobile through JSON files exported with the Bodymovin plugin.

#### Key Features
- 🎨 Designer-friendly, high complexity animations
- 🪶 Lightweight JSON files compared to video/GIF
- 📱 Vector-based and resolution-independent
- 💻 Cross-platform consistency (web, iOS, Android)
- 🧩 Easy implementation

#### Use Cases
- Complex vector animations and illustrations
- Animated icons and logos
- Loading indicators
- Storytelling animations
- Brand animations

#### Limitations
- Requires After Effects for creation
- Limited ability to modify animation via code
- Complex animations can tax CPU/GPU
- Not for layout or UI transitions

```javascript
// Basic Lottie implementation
const animation = lottie.loadAnimation({
  container: document.getElementById('lottie-container'),
  renderer: 'svg',
  loop: true,
  autoplay: true,
  path: 'animation.json'
});
```

### 📜 AOS (Animate On Scroll)

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Production%20Ready-success)

AOS is a small, lightweight library that focuses specifically on scroll-triggered animations, making elements animate into view as the user scrolls.

#### Key Features
- 📜 Simple scroll-triggered animations
- 🪶 Extremely lightweight (~5-6KB)
- 🚫 No custom JS required, just data attributes
- 🎨 CSS-powered for performance
- 📱 Configurable and responsive

#### Use Cases
- Revealing content on scroll

- Marketing websites
- Landing pages

#### Limitations
- Limited to simple entrance animations
- No complex scroll interactions
- Preset animations might not cover all needs
- No other interaction types (click, hover)

```html
<!-- Basic AOS implementation -->
<div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
  This element will fade up when scrolled into view
</div>
```

### 🔄 Motion One: Modern Web Animations with WAAPI

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Production%20Ready-success)

Motion One is a newer animation library built on top of the Web Animations API (WAAPI), designed to be lightweight and leverage the browser's native animation capabilities.

#### Key Features
- ⚡ Tiny size with native performance (~2.6KB core)
- 🔄 Offloads animation to browser thread
- 🖥️ Hardware-accelerated by default
- 📜 Support for ScrollTimeline for scroll animations
- 🌐 Framework-agnostic

#### Use Cases
- High-performance animations
- When bundle size is critical
- Modern browser experiences
- Complements framework-specific libraries
- Scroll-linked animations

#### Limitations
- Newer library with smaller community
- WAAPI reliance limits older browser support
- Fewer specialized utilities out-of-box
- No built-in development tools

```javascript
// Basic Motion One example
import { animate } from "motion";

animate(".element", 
  { x: 100, opacity: 1 }, 
  { duration: 0.5, easing: "ease-in-out" }
);
```

### 🎨 Pure CSS/Native Approaches

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Production%20Ready-success)

Using CSS transitions, animations, and the Web Animations API directly without additional libraries can be ideal for simple animations.

#### Key Features
- 🪶 Zero additional script overhead
- ⚡ Native browser performance
- 🚀 GPU acceleration for transforms/opacity
- 📦 No external dependencies
- 🔄 Future-proof as CSS evolves

#### Use Cases
- Simple UI transitions
- Hover/focus effects
- Basic fade/slide animations
- When minimizing dependencies is critical
- Performance-critical applications

#### Limitations
- Limited control for complex sequences
- No timeline or orchestration
- Harder to create dynamic, conditional animations
- No built-in scroll synchronization

```css
/* Basic CSS animation */
.element {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, opacity 0.3s ease;
}

.element:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
  opacity: 0.8;
}
```

## 🧩 Combining Libraries

Different animation libraries can be combined effectively for complex projects:

### Recommended Combinations

- **GSAP + Three.js**: Use GSAP to animate Three.js objects and camera
- **Anime.js + AOS**: Combine scroll detection with complex animations
- **Framer Motion + Lottie**: React UI animations with Lottie illustrations
- **Motion One + Pure CSS**: High-performance animations with minimal footprint

### Best Practices for Integration

1. **Scope libraries to different concerns** - Avoid animating the same element with multiple libraries
2. **Use a master orchestrator** - Designate one library (often GSAP) as the coordinator
3. **Watch performance** - Monitor for conflicts or excessive resource usage
4. **Consistent timing and easing** - Maintain uniform motion design across libraries
5. **Lazy load when possible** - Only load libraries when needed

## 🚀 Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

- ✅ **Animate transform and opacity** whenever possible
- ✅ **Stagger animations** rather than animating everything at once
- ✅ Use `will-change` or layer promotion wisely
- ✅ Avoid expensive JavaScript in animation loops
- ✅ Throttle/debounce scroll events or use IntersectionObserver
- ✅ Always use requestAnimationFrame for custom animations
- ✅ Optimize media and asset sizes
- ✅ Profile and test on real target devices

### Responsive Considerations

- ✅ Use relative units for animations
- ✅ Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings
- ✅ Simplify animations on lower-end devices
- ✅ Test on various viewports and device types
- ✅ Consider loading alternatives for older browsers
